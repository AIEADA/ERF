PeleC Documentation
===================

PeleC documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_, making
use of `Breathe <http://breathe.readthedocs.io>`_ to pull in source documentation
for specific functions extracted using `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org>`_. With 
Sphinx, documentation is written in *Restructured Text*. reST is a markup language
similar to Markdown, but with somewhat greater capabilities (and idiosyncrasies). There
are several `primers <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_
available to get started. One gotcha is that indentation matters.

The documentation goal is simple:

#. Functions are documented in source, in c/c++ by using comment blocks before the function
   declaration, primarily in the *header* file.
#. Examples, more detailed usage, and discussion of how the function/class fits into the
   context of PeleC is written by hand in reST files

When it is necessary to refer to a function in the reST/sphinx documentation, use the
breathe `directives <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives.html>`_. For example,
a function signature and documentation would be generated by::

.. doxygenfunction:: amrex::surroundingNodes(const Box&, int)
